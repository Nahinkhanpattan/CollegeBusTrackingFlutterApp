# Firebase Email Verification Setup Guide

## Issue: Email Verification Not Working

The email verification (OTP) is not working because Firebase Authentication needs proper configuration for email verification.

## Steps to Fix Email Verification:

### 1. Enable Email Verification in Firebase Console

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `collegebustrackingflutterapp`
3. Go to **Authentication** → **Settings** → **User actions**
4. Enable **Email verification**
5. Customize the email template if needed

### 2. Configure Email Templates

1. In Authentication → Templates
2. Click on **Email address verification**
3. Customize the email template:
   - Subject: "Verify your email for College Bus Tracker"
   - Customize the message and action URL

### 3. Set up Custom Domain (Optional but Recommended)

1. Go to Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
2. Add your domain if you have one
3. This helps with email deliverability

### 4. Test Email Verification

1. Register a new user
2. Check if verification email is sent
3. Click the verification link in email
4. User should be marked as verified

### 5. Configure SMTP (For Production)

For production apps, consider setting up custom SMTP:

1. Go to Authentication → Settings → SMTP settings
2. Configure your SMTP provider (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
3. This improves email deliverability

## Current Code Issues Fixed:

1. **Driver Registration**: Fixed to not require email verification
2. **Email Verification Flow**: Properly implemented OTP verification
3. **Login Logic**: Fixed to check email verification status correctly

## Testing:

1. Try registering as a student/teacher with a real email
2. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)
3. Click the verification link
4. Try logging in - should work after verification

## Note:

The current Firebase project is already configured with basic email verification. The issue was in the code logic, which has been fixed in the updates above.
